Mowed, edged, made a Home Depot run, cleared stumps, made glazed short ribs, watched Open Range, wife is playing Eagles songs on the piano

Lawn haters get bent

Babylon wages war on Babylon
Babylon vanquishes the evil of Babylon
Babylon falls and Babylon rises
The wars aren't real but the genocides of your people are
How they massacre you like cattle
How God weeps for your misguided souls
Their merchants did trade
Their leaders wore OUR cross
Are you truly so blinded by the serpent's propaganda?
The head bites the tail
In death they are born
