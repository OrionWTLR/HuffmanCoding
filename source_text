From the 1920s through the 1940s, the Mission Armory served as San Francisco's primary sports venue, eventually earning
the nickname "the Madison Square Garden of the West."[12] For almost three decades, at least two prizefights were held
in the Drill Court each week.

One very notable fight included a light heavyweight title fight between Young Corbett III and Jackie Fields. Other
notable fights that took place in the Armory included matches between Mike Teague and Jack Thompson (both were
welterweight champions); and Corbett and Pete Myers in 1929.[13]

1976â€“2006
After 1976, the building was largely unused for the next 30 years, though in 1978 the building was registered as a Class
2 historical landmark in the National Register of Historic Places. Several spaceship-interior scenes in the Star Wars
movie The Empire Strikes Back were filmed there,[14] and the San Francisco Opera used the large inner court of The
Armory for set construction and rehearsals until the mid-1990s.[15]

By this time, The Armory was in a heavy state of disrepair.[16][17] Various uses of the building were proposed from 1996
to 2006, including self storage units,[15] a rehabilitation clinic, a gym with a rock wall, a dot-com office park,[9] a
telecommunications switching center,[18] luxury housing,[19] and low-income housing.

Many of these proposals were marked by acrimonious debates between various community interests. Concerns over
gentrification, social and environmental impact or the unsuitability of the structure for various uses resulted in none
of the various plans for the structure reaching fruition.[11][18][19][20] The building eventually came to be described,
variously, as "a herd of white elephants",[16] "cursed",[8] and "not a friendly building".[20] The stairs in the main
entrance of the armory also became a well-known skateboarding location referred to as "3-Up 3-Down".[21]
